//"Try making a complex bumper out of many shapes" ---- I added a few objects in the way so the chaos balls don't just hit the 4 walls
//"Try changing the footsteps audio to something that makes sense with the water" --- Changed the sound to walking in water instead of solid ground
//"Change the size or shape of the player's bumper" ---- turned it into a cylinder to make it a bit more challanging to hit the balls to their correct spot.
//Adding a restart button -- I made a reset button when the game is finished, it has its own box and isnt apart of the game over screen
